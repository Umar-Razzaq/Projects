# Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Network
The goal of this noteboook is to design a convolutional neural network to classify images from CIFAR-10. CIFAR-10 is a subset of CIFAR-100 with 10 and 100 being number of classes. They were collected by Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. We'll be building small CNNs using Keras to solve this classification task.


Please note:
- We will save each trained model weights and tensorboard logs in different folder. Using proper names for the model.
- We will show trainings in this notebook file, so make sure that the printings and figures are available on this notebook file
- Your system memory may overflow. In that case, please reset memory for trained model(s) keeping printed logs and history of trained model. History of all trained models could be used to plot the trends.
- For trends you shall also use tensorboard logs
